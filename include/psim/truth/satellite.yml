comment: >
    Models a satellite consisting of two point masses, separated by a long
    (on the order of kilometers) tensioned string or rod. For simplicity, all
    calculations are in ECI.

          Satellite's orbital total energy. This is essentially the difference
          of the kinetic and potential energies.
